# Onion Monero Blockchain Explorer

Curently available Monero blockchain explorer websites have several limitations which are of special importance to privacy-oriented users:

 - they use JavaScript,
 - have images which might be used for [cookieless tracking](http://lucb1e.com/rp/cookielesscookies/),
 - track users activates through google analytics,
 - are closed sourced,
 - are not available as hidden services,
 - provide only basic search capabilities,
 - do not support Monero testnet


In this example, these limitations are addressed by development of
an Onion Monero Blockchain Explorer. The example not only shows how to use Monero C++ libraries, but also demonstrates how to use:

 - [crow](https://github.com/ipkn/crow) - C++ micro web framework
 - [lmdb++](https://github.com/bendiken/lmdbxx) - C++ wrapper for the LMDB
 - [mstch](https://github.com/no1msd/mstch) - C++ {{mustache}} templates
 - [json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) - JSON for Modern C++
 - [date](https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date) - C++ date and time library
 - [fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt) - Small, safe and fast string formatting library

## Prerequisite

Instruction for Monero 0.10.1 compilation and Monero headers and libraries setup are
as shown here:
 - [Compile Monero on Ubuntu 16.04 x64](https://github.com/moneroexamples/compile-monero-09-on-ubuntu-16-04)
 - [lmdbcpp-monero](https://github.com/moneroexamples/lmdbcpp-monero.git) (optional)

## Compile and run the explorer

##### Monero headers and libraries setup

The Onion Explorer uses Monero C++ libraries and headers. 
 Instructions how to download source files and compile Monero,
 setup header and library files are presented here:

- https://github.com/moneroexamples/compile-monero-09-on-ubuntu-16-04 (Ubuntu 16.04)
- https://github.com/moneroexamples/compile-monero-09-on-arch-linux (Arch Linux)


##### Custom lmdb database (optional)

Most unique search abilities of the Onion Explorer are achieved through using
a [custom lmdb database](https://github.com/moneroexamples/lmdbcpp-monero.git) constructed based on the Monero blockchain.
The reason for the custom database is that Monero's own lmdb database has limited
search abilities. For example, its not possible to search for a tx having a
 given key image, except by performing an exhaustive search on the blockchain which is very time consuming.

Instruction how to compile the `lmdbcpp-monero` are provided here:

 - https://github.com/moneroexamples/lmdbcpp-monero.git

The custom database is rather big, 12GB now, and it must be running alongside Monero deamon
so that it keeps updating itself with new information from new blocks as they are added
to the blockchain. Also, by default it is 10 blocks behind the current blockchain height
to minimize indexing/saving orphaned blocks.

For these reasons, its use is optional. However, without it, some searches wont be possible,
e.g., searching for key images, output and tx public keys, encrypted payments id.

##### Compile and run the explorer
Once the Monero is compiled and setup, the explorer can be downloaded and compiled
as follows:

```bash
# download the source code
git clone https://github.com/moneroexamples/onion-monero-blockchain-explorer.git

# enter the downloaded sourced code folder
cd onion-monero-blockchain-explorer

# make a build folder and enter it
mkdir build && cd build

# create the makefile
cmake ..

# compile
make
```

When compilation finishes executable `xmrblocks` should be created.

To run it:
```
./xmrblocks
```

Example output:

```bash
[mwo@arch onion-monero-blockchain-explorer]$ ./xmrblocks
2016-May-28 10:04:49.160280 Blockchain initialized. last block: 1056761, d0.h0.m12.s47 time ago, current difficulty: 1517857750
(2016-05-28 02:04:49) [INFO    ] Crow/0.1 server is running, local port 8081

                                        monero address string
```

## Enable SSL (https)

By default, the explorer does not use ssl. But it has such a functionality. 

As an example, you can generate your own ssl certificates as follows:

```bash
cd /tmp # example folder
openssl genrsa -out server.key 1024
openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr
openssl x509 -req -days 3650 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt
```

Having the `crt` and `key` files, run `xmrblocks` in the following way:

```bash
./xmrblocks --ssl-crt-file=/tmp/server.crt --ssl-key-file=/tmp/server.key 
```

Note: Because we generated our own certificate, modern browsers will complain
about it as they cant verify the signatures against any third party. So probably
for any practical use need to have properly issued ssl certificates. 

## JSON API

The explorer has JSON api. For the API, it uses conventions defined by [JSend](https://labs.omniti.com/labs/jsend).
